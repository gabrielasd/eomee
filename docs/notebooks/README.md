## Tutorial notebooks
This folder contains exmaple notebooks to showcase the basic features of PyEOM. The tutorials include:

- How to compute transition energies from the ground state
reduced density matrices: getting_started.ipynb
- How to compute the dynamic correlation energy with ERPA-based approaches: evaluate_correlation_energy.ipynb
- How to evaluate the generalized atomic orbitals from Extended Koopmansâ€™ theorem results: generalized_atomic_orbitals.ipynb


After installing Jupyter Notebook with:
    
```bash
pip install notebook
```

The tutorials can be run by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

The last two tutorials require some extra dependencies. These can be installed by running:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install qc-iodata
pip install git+https://github.com/theochem/gbasis.git
```
